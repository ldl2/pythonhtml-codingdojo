<p>First appearing in 1991, Python is a general-purpose, high-level, interpreted programming language whose design focus emphasizes code readability.  Whether for 
processing/analyzing data to powering many well know applications, Python is not only a great language for new programmers but also powerful enough for seasoned 
developers building whatever they can think of.</p>
